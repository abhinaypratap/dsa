**Stack Data Structure**: 
- In Stack *Last In First Out(LIFO)* works.
- A Stack is an object or an *abstract data structure(ADT)* that allows the following operations:
	- `Push`: Add an element to the top of a Stack
	- `Pop`: Remove an element from the top of a Stack
	- `IsEmpty`: Check if the Stack is empty
	- `IsFull`: Check if the Stack is full
	- `Peek`: Get the value of the top element without removing it
- **Working of Stack**:

**Queue Data Structure**:
- *First In First Out(FIFO)*: the item that goes in first is the item that comes out first too.
- A Queue is an object or an *abstract data Structure(ADT)* that allows the following operations:
	- `Enqueue`: Add an element to the end of the queue
	- `Dequeue`: Remove an element from the end of the queue
	- `IsEmpty`: Check if the queue is empty
	- `IsFull`: Check if the queue is full
	- `Peek`: Get the value of the front of the queue without removing it.
- **Working of Queue**:
- Types of Queue:
	1. Simple Queue
	2. Circular Queue
	3. Priority Queue
	4. Double Ended Queue (Deque)

**Algorithm**: An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions in sequence to solve a problem.
- Time, Memory & Scalability
- The efficiency of an algorithm depends on the amount of time, storage and other resources required to execute the algorithm. The efficiency is measured with the help of asymptotic notations.
- The study of change in performance of the algorithm with the change in the order of the input size is defined as **Asymptotic Analysis**.
- **Asymptotic Notations** are the mathematical notations used to describe the running time of an algorithm when the input tends towards a particular value or a limiting value.
	- Theta Notation
	- Big-O Notation
	- Omega Notation

**Master Theorem**: Master theorem is used in calculating the time complexity of recurrence relations (divide and conquer algorithm), which are of the form:
>T(n) = aT(n/b) * f(n)

**Merge Sort Algorithm**: Merge Sort is a kind of Divide and Conquer algorithm.
