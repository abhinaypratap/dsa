# Data Structures & Algorithms

**Algorithm**: An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions in sequence to solve a problem.
- Time, Memory & Scalability
- The efficiency of an algorithm depends on the amount of time, storage and other resources required to execute the algorithm. The efficiency is measured with the help of asymptotic notations.
- The study of change in performance of the algorithm with the change in the order of the input size is defined as **Asymptotic Analysis**.
- **Asymptotic Notations** are the mathematical notations used to dexcribe the running time of an algorithm when the input tends towards a particular value or a limiting value.
